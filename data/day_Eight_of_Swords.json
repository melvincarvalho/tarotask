Okay, here's a short daily description for the Eight of Swords, keeping in mind the Crowley Thoth Tarot and its general themes:

**Option 1 (Focus on Limitation):**

> **Eight of Swords (Today):**  Feelings of being trapped or restricted are strong.  Your thoughts might be creating your own limitations.  Notice where you're feeling bound, but be aware that these are largely mental constructs.  Don't allow anxiety to cloud your judgment.  Clarity comes from within.

**Option 2 (Focus on Mental Clarity):**

> **Eight of Swords (Today):**  The Eight of Swords suggests you might be overthinking.  Are you allowing fear to dictate your actions? Acknowledge your anxieties, but don't let them paralyze you. Step back, gain perspective, and you'll see your options more clearly. 

**Option 3 (Focus on Self-Imposed Restriction):**

> **Eight of Swords (Today):**  Todayâ€™s challenges might be self-imposed.  The Eight of Swords asks: where are you holding yourself back? Are your thoughts limiting your potential? This card encourages you to release those restrictive patterns and embrace freedom through clear thinking.

**Key elements I've tried to incorporate:**

*   **Limitation/Restriction:** The primary theme of the Eight of Swords.
*   **Mental Constructs:** The Crowley Thoth deck emphasizes the power of the mind in creating our reality, particularly with the Suit of Swords.
*   **Self-imposed:** Often, the limitations are not external, but what we impose on ourselves.
*   **Potential for clarity:** There's always a hint of hope that recognizing the mental trap is the first step towards breaking free.
*   **Concise & Daily:** Short, easily digestible for a daily reflection.

You can choose the option that resonates most with you or modify them further to better suit your style. Remember that the specific nuance of a reading will always depend on its context.
