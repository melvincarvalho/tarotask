Okay, here's a short daily description for the Queen of Swords, drawing from its Thoth/Crowley interpretations:

**Queen of Swords (Daily):** Today calls for clarity and sharp intellect.  Cut through the illusions and see things as they truly are. Don't shy away from difficult truths; face them head-on with honesty and integrity. You might need to be assertive and stand firm in your convictions.  Use your logic and reasoning, not your emotions, to guide your decisions.  Focus on achieving your goals with precision and determination. While compassionate, maintain boundaries and avoid being drawn into emotional dramas. A sharp mind and clear communication are your allies today.
