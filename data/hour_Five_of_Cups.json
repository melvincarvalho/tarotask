Okay, here's a short daily description for the Crowley Thoth Five of Cups, formatted as you might see it in a daily reading:

**Five of Cups (Disappointment) - Crowley Thoth**

Today, you might feel a sense of loss or disappointment.  Things may not be panning out as you hoped, and you might be dwelling on what's been lost rather than what remains. Don't get bogged down in the sadness; acknowledge the emotions, but try to shift your focus towards the possibilities that still exist.  Look for the underlying lessons within the pain, and let go of what no longer serves you. There's always a chance for renewal. Remember, the tears are part of the process.
