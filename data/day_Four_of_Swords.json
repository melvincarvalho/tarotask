**Short Daily Description: Four of Swords (Crowley/Thoth)**

**Today, seek sanctuary and stillness. The Four of Swords invites you to step away from the mental fray and recharge your mind.  This isn't about defeat, but about conscious withdrawal for healing and reflection.  Rest, meditate, or engage in quiet activities.  By taking a pause now, you'll return with clarity and renewed strength.**
