Okay, here are a few short hourly descriptions for the Crowley Thoth Three of Swords, keeping in mind its general themes of sorrow, heartbreak, and difficult truths:

**Option 1 (Short & Direct):**

> **Hour:** A difficult truth surfaces. Expect potential sorrow or heartbreak. The Three of Swords cuts deep.

**Option 2 (Slightly More Detail):**

> **Hour:** Disappointment or painful revelation is possible.  The Three of Swords brings awareness, but not without its sting.  Navigate emotions with care.

**Option 3 (Focus on Processing):**

> **Hour:**  This hour brings a need to acknowledge pain.  The Three of Swords suggests allowing yourself to feel the sorrow before moving through it.  Time for reflection.

**Option 4 (More Action-Oriented):**

> **Hour:**  A difficult choice or realization may be necessary. The Three of Swords demands honesty and direct confrontation with the source of pain, however unpleasant.

**Option 5 (Focus on Internal Struggle):**

> **Hour:** An internal conflict or heartache surfaces. The Three of Swords pierces the veil of illusion. Observe what comes up without judgment.


**Key Considerations for Using these:**

* **Context is King:** These are very general. You can adapt them further based on the specific question or spread in your reading.
* **Client Sensitivity:** Be mindful of the querent. A direct "heartbreak" warning might be jarring. Use softer language if needed.
* **Positive Potential:**  Even though the card is challenging, remember the lesson. The pain is a necessary step towards growth and clarity. You might add, "though ultimately leading to healing."
* **Brevity:** Hourly descriptions need to be concise, so focus on the core meaning.

Choose the description that best suits your needs and style. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other tarot questions.
