Okay, here's a short daily description for the Seven of Cups, drawing from Crowley's Thoth Tarot:

**Today, you might feel overwhelmed by choices and possibilities. Illusions and desires dance before your eyes, promising easy paths. Don't get lost in fantasy. A moment of sober reflection is needed to discern the true value from the tempting mirage. Focus on what aligns with your deeper purpose, not just the fleeting allure.**
