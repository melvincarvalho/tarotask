Okay, here's a short daily description for the Crowley Tarot's Ten of Swords, formatted as you might see in a daily tarot app:

**Card:** Ten of Swords (Crowley)

**Daily Description:**

> The end of the road. Today, you might be facing a painful culmination, a situation that feels utterly defeated.  This is the *bitter* end, but it's also a clean break. Let go of the struggle, surrender to the outcome. This isn't a time for new beginnings, but for *necessary* endings. What must be finished?  Release it, and make space for the dawn to follow.
