**Hourly Description - Knight of Swords (Thoth):**

**Focus:**  A burst of mental energy and decisive action. This hour is all about cutting through the clutter with sharp intellect and swift movement.

**Possible Experiences:**

*   **Mid-Hour (15-45 minutes):**  Forward momentum is key. You're likely to be engaged in fast-paced activity, possibly mentally or physically.  Obstacles are met with direct confrontation.  This can feel exhilarating, but also potentially reckless if not tempered with awareness.
*  **End of Hour (45-60 minutes):**  The intensity starts to wind down, but the effects remain. You've likely achieved a goal or broken through a blockage.  Take a moment to reflect on the speed and impact of your actions â€“ have they served you well?  Are there any loose ends to manage?  

**Key Words/Themes:**

*   Quick thinking, decisive action, assertiveness
*   Intellectual drive, logic, strategic planning
*   Impetuousness, potential for recklessness, need for focus
*   Breakthroughs, cutting through the confusion
