Okay, here are a few options for short, hourly descriptions of the Crowley Thoth Death card, keeping in mind it's not about literal, physical death, but transformation and change:

**Option 1 (Concise & Direct):**

* **Hour of Release:** Shedding the old.  Embrace the necessary endings for new beginnings to bloom. Transformation is upon us.

**Option 2 (More Evocative):**

* **Hour of the Phoenix:**  What has died is not lost, but transformed. Feel the stirrings of rebirth from the ashes of the past. Let go, and rise.

**Option 3 (Focus on the Process):**

* **Hour of Necessary Shift:**  Expect profound change.  Let go of resistance and flow with the inevitable. Embrace the power of transition, even if it feels unsettling.

**Option 4 (Slightly Darker & More Intense):**

* **Hour of the Great Revealer:**  The old structures crumble.  Truth is laid bare. Fear not the process, but know that radical change is required for growth.

**Option 5 (More Hopeful & Forward-Looking):**

* **Hour of Unfolding Potential:** A chapter closes, and a new one opens. Release what no longer serves you and embrace the possibilities that lie ahead. Seeds of new life are sown.

**Key Considerations for Choosing:**

* **Context:**  Where will this description be used? A general app? A tarot journal?
* **Tone:** Do you want it to be more positive, more neutral, or a bit more challenging?
* **Audience:** Who is the likely reader?

You can mix and match elements from these options to create a description that best fits your needs. For example, you might combine elements of Option 2 and Option 5 for:

* **Hour of Transformation & Growth:**  Feel the stirrings of rebirth as a chapter closes. Release what no longer serves you and embrace the potential that lies ahead.

I hope these are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
