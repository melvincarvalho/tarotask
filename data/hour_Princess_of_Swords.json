Okay, here's a short hourly description for the Crowley Thoth Tarot's Princess of Swords, keeping in mind its energy and symbolism:

**Hourly Description Options for the Princess of Swords (Thoth Deck)**

**Option 1 (Focus on the Intellect & Fresh Ideas):**

> "This hour crackles with mental energy. Be open to new ideas and quick insights. There's a fresh, almost restless, intellect at play. Communicate clearly and sharply; don't be afraid to ask probing questions. This is a time for sharp thinking and decisive action, though perhaps lacking the experience of wisdom. Keep your focus and channel your mental agility."

**Option 2 (Focus on Impatience & Restlessness):**

> "A sense of impatience hangs in the air this hour. You might feel a restless urge to break free from constraints. Ideas flow rapidly, but they might lack follow-through. Be mindful of sharp words and impulsivity. While your mind is keen, try to temper it with patience and understanding. Use this energy to strategize, but avoid rash actions."

**Option 3 (Focus on Truth & Clear Communication):**

> "This hour demands honesty and clarity. The Princess of Swords seeks truth with uncompromising intensity. Be prepared to hear and speak your mind, even if it's difficult. Communication is key, but make sure it's honest and well-intentioned. Avoid gossip or deception. This hour favors intellectual pursuits and direct confrontation."

**Option 4 (A More Nuanced Approach):**

> "A mix of youthful vigor and sharp intellect characterizes this hour. You might feel pulled towards new possibilities, but be aware of potential naivety. The air is sharp, clear, and invigorating. Use your mental clarity to your advantage, but temper it with a willingness to learn and adapt. Action is favored, but with conscious thought."

**Key Elements I've Incorporated:**

**How to Use:**

These are suggestions, feel free to adapt them based on the specific situation or if you're creating your own spread interpretations. You might choose the description that best fits the "flavor" of the day or the energy you sense is most prominent.  You can use these hourly, or for 1-2 hour blocks of time.
