Okay, here's a short daily description for the Three of Swords from the Crowley Thoth Tarot, formatted as you requested:

```json
{
  "card": "Three of Swords",
  "description": "Today, expect a sharp cut. This could be emotional pain, a difficult truth, or a necessary separation. While it feels like a piercing blow, remember that these experiences are often crucial for growth. Acknowledge the hurt, but don't dwell. Clarity emerges through the pain; healing follows."
}
```
