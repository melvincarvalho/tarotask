Okay, here are a few short, hourly descriptions for the Crowley Tarot card, the Five of Swords, playing on different aspects of its energy:

**Option 1: Focusing on Conflict & Defeat**

* **(Hour: Anytime the energy feels draining)**  "The Five of Swords. A struggle where no one truly wins. Feeling depleted? Take a breath, regroup, and remember that sometimes letting go is the true victory." 
* **(Hour: Mid-morning slump)** "Five of Swords energy this hour. Maybe it's time to step back from the argument, the competition. The path to real progress isn't always through a fight."
* **(Hour: Post-meeting or challenging conversation)** "The Five of Swords shows its face. Did you 'win' but still feel empty? Assess the cost, and remember that dominance isn't always strength."

**Option 2: Focusing on Communication Breakdown**

* **(Hour: When you feel misunderstood)** "Five of Swords. Misunderstandings abound. Are you truly being heard, or are words being used as weapons? Seek clarity, not conquest."
* **(Hour: During a difficult email or phone call)** "A Five of Swords moment. Be mindful of your tone and intentions. Choose your words carefully; they can wound, or they can heal."
* **(Hour: After an argument)** "The Five of Swords lingers. The battle may be over, but the wounds remain. Reflect on the communication breakdown, and how you might approach things differently next time."

**Option 3: Focusing on the Mental Landscape**

* **(Hour: When your mind is racing)** "Five of Swords energy is up. Thoughts battling for dominance within your own mind.  Ground yourself.  Seek a moment of quiet to break the internal conflict."
* **(Hour: Before making a difficult decision)** "The Five of Swords asks: what battles are you choosing? Are you focusing on the win, or the aftermath? Consider all perspectives before proceeding."
* **(Hour: When you feel scattered)** "Five of Swords. Mental fatigue. Is the internal arguing draining you? Seek a break from the mental noise and find a peaceful focus."

**General Note:**

* You can adjust these to be even shorter, such as "Five of Swords: No real wins today," or "Five of Swords - choose your battles wisely." 
* The "hourly" aspect is fluid, and you can use these descriptions whenever you sense the energy of the Five of Swords arising during the day. 
* The core message of the Five of Swords (especially in the Crowley deck) is to examine the futility of winning battles where the costs outweigh the reward. It's a call for inner peace and clear communication over hollow victories.
