Okay, here's a short hourly description for the Crowley Thoth Nine of Wands, focusing on the potential energy of each hour:

**Hour 1:** **Initial Resistance:** A feeling of being guarded, hesitant to fully engage. You might feel the need to protect yourself or your ideas. Don't overthink it, just be aware of the boundaries you're setting. 

**Hour 2:** **Gathering Strength:** You're taking stock of your resources. Assess what you have available and where you might need to reinforce your position. Prepare mentally and emotionally for any challenges ahead.

**Hour 3:** **Under Pressure:** The pressure mounts. You may feel tested or pushed in some way. This is where your resilience is truly put to the test. Draw on your reserves.

**Hour 4:** **Controlled Response:** You react with a measured and thoughtful approach. You're not overwhelmed by the pressure. You use your past experiences to guide you.

**Hour 5:** **Holding the Line:** You are maintaining your position, refusing to be pushed back. There's a strong sense of will and determination, perhaps even a touch of stubbornness. 

**Hour 6:** **A Pause for Breath:** The immediate pressure has eased. Take a moment to reassess your position. You're not out of the woods yet, but you can gather your energy.

**Hour 7:** **Solid Foundation:** The hard work you've put in is showing. Your foundation is strong and you're ready for the next phase, whatever that may be.

**Hour 8:** **Vigilant Preparedness:** You are in a state of alert, ready for anything. You may feel a bit anxious, but you're also feeling incredibly capable.

**Hour 9:** **Almost There:** The final push is needed. Don't falter now. You've come so far, keep going. The finish line is in sight.

**Hour 10:** **Lessons Learned:** Reflect on what you've been through. Take the time to appreciate your strength and resilience. Lessons are now integrating within your being.

**Hour 11:** **Inner Resolve:** You are now in a place of deep inner knowing of your own capabilities. This brings you strength as you move forward

**Hour 12:** **Forward Movement:** You are more relaxed but your internal boundaries still exist, making sure you move forward into new experiences at your own pace and knowing your limitations.

**Key Considerations When Using These:**

*   **Context is King:** Remember that this is a general interpretation. The actual meaning will depend heavily on the question being asked and the surrounding cards.
*   **Personal Resonance:** Encourage the person you're reading for to reflect on how these interpretations resonate with their own situation.
*   **Fluid Energy:** Energy is not static. These are just snapshots of potential experiences.
