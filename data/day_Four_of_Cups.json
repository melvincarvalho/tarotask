Opportunities might be presented, but you may be too inwardly focused to recognize them.  It's a day to examine any feelings of boredom or disillusionment.  Don't get stuck in a rut; try to see things from a new perspective, or gently nudge yourself out of your comfort zone. A little gratitude for what you have might just shift your mood.",
