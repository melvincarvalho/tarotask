**Daily Description for The Hanged Man (Crowley Thoth):**

Today, consider where you might be holding on too tightly. Are you clinging to old patterns or beliefs, even when they feel restrictive? The Hanged Man invites you to surrender control and see things from a new perspective. It's a day for quiet reflection, perhaps even a temporary pause in your usual routine. Sometimes, the greatest progress comes through stillness and a willingness to sacrifice short-term comfort for long-term growth.  Look for wisdom in the stillness and trust that a new understanding is emerging. It might feel uncomfortable or awkward, but it's a necessary phase of transformation.
