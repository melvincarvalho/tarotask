Okay, here's a short daily description for the Crowley Tarot card, The Chariot, keeping in mind the Crowley/Thoth deck's specific symbolism:

**Today's Focus: The Chariot (Crowley/Thoth)**

**Keywords:**  Triumph through Will, Controlled Force, Victory, Direction, Self-Mastery, Inner Drive.

**Description:**  Today, harness the power of your inner will. The Chariot urges you to take the reins of your life and steer yourself towards your goals with focused determination.  You have the potential for great achievement, but it requires discipline and the ability to balance opposing forces.  Don't let your emotions derail your progress; channel your energy with intention.  This is a day for overcoming obstacles and moving forward with confident momentum. Victory is within reach, but only through concentrated effort and unwavering self-control.

**Possible Questions to Ask Yourself:** 
* What are the opposing forces I need to harmonize?
* Am I directing my will towards worthy goals?
* Where do I need to exert more control and focus?
* What victory am I striving for today?

This description emphasizes the Crowley deck's focus on the will, control, and the harmonization of opposing forces. It's less about literal physical travel and more about the journey of inner mastery.
