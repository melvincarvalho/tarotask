Okay, here's a short daily description for the Seven of Swords, drawing on Crowley's Thoth Tarot interpretation:

**Daily Description: Seven of Swords (Lord of Futility)**

Today might feel a bit like you're trying to get away with something, or that your efforts are somehow... unsatisfying. The Seven of Swords highlights a situation where your plans may feel fragmented, perhaps even dishonest, or that you're putting energy into something that won't yield the results you hope for. It's a day to be mindful of shortcuts and quick fixes – are they truly serving your best interest? Are you being transparent with yourself and others? Consider if you're holding onto something that needs to be released. Perhaps it’s time to reassess your strategy and focus your energy on more sustainable solutions.
