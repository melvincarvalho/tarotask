Okay, here's a short daily description for the Crowley Thoth Ten of Wands, designed to be used daily:

**Ten of Wands (Oppression/Strain)**

Today, you may feel the weight of your responsibilities. You might be carrying too much, feeling overwhelmed by deadlines, commitments, or even just the sheer volume of tasks before you.  This isn't about failing, but about the burden becoming too heavy. Consider where you can delegate, let go of non-essentials, or simply ask for help. Pace yourself, and remember that efficiency and ease come from balance, not from pushing yourself to the limit.  It's a day to review your commitments and find ways to lighten your load.
