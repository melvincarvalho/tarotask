Okay, here are a few short, hourly-style descriptions for the Seven of Swords, drawing from its Crowley/Thoth interpretation, which often emphasizes trickery, instability, and a kind of desperate cleverness:

**Option 1 (Focus on Cunning & Flight):**

*   **Hour 1:**  Feeling scattered. Brain buzzing with half-formed plans. Avoid big commitments, focus on small, quick wins.
*   **Hour 2:** A sudden urge to slip away unnoticed. Be mindful of where you're leaving and what you're taking.
*   **Hour 3:**  A calculated move might seem appealing. Assess the long-term consequences before acting on impulse.
*   **Hour 4:**  Clever solutions are within reach, but ensure they're not at another's expense.
*   **Hour 5:**  Restless energy. A good time to review your strategy, not to launch a new initiative.
*   **Hour 6:**  A small victory today might feel like a big escape. Recognize it for what it is.

**Option 2 (Focus on Instability & Evasion):**

*   **Hour 1:**  Uneasy feeling, like something is just out of reach. Don't grasp too tightly at things right now.
*   **Hour 2:**  Tempted to take shortcuts? Consider the risks before abandoning the steady path.
*   **Hour 3:**  Avoidance is calling. Try to address problems directly rather than letting them fester.
*   **Hour 4:**  Plans may shift unexpectedly. Prepare to be flexible and adapt.
*   **Hour 5:**  A sense of being pulled in multiple directions. Find your center and focus.
*   **Hour 6:**  Time for reflection, not immediate action. Be honest with yourself about your motivations.

**Option 3 (A More Direct Warning):**

*   **Hour 1:**  Sly thoughts are brewing. Watch out for the temptation to deceive or be deceived.
*   **Hour 2:**  Things are unstable. Don't rely on promises or guarantees at the moment.
*   **Hour 3:**  A clever maneuver might feel right, but check your integrity. Is it truly the best course?
*   **Hour 4:**  A sense of things slipping away. Don't try to hold on too tightly - learn to adapt.
*   **Hour 5:**  Steer clear of gossip and backstabbing. Focus on your own ethical path.
*   **Hour 6:**  Time for honesty, even if it's uncomfortable.  Address any shaky foundations.

**Key Themes to Convey:**

*   **Trickery/Deception:** The Seven of Swords often implies sneaky behavior, not always malicious, but often self-serving.
*   **Instability:**  Things are in flux, and plans might not pan out as expected.
*   **Flight/Evasion:** A desire to avoid confrontation or responsibility is present.
*   **Partial Success:**  A "victory" might not be lasting or complete, suggesting a need to look deeper.
*   **Cleverness (but perhaps misguided):**  Intelligence is present, but it's being used in ways that might ultimately be detrimental.

**How to Choose:**

*   **Consider your tone:**  Are you aiming for playful, serious, or cautionary?
*   **Consider your audience:**  Are they familiar with the Thoth Tarot or are these general interpretations?

I hope these provide a good starting point! Let me know if you have any other requests!
